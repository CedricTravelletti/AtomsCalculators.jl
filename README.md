This is a calculation interface for [AtomsBase](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/AtomsBase.jl) meant to extend the interface for calculators, for example energies, forces, and so forth. At this moment this is a preliminary version with molecular dynamics and various geometry optimizations in mid. In the future more general functionality may be added. Utility functions exist for extending functions definitions, and testing the implementations. See [the documentation](https://JuliaMolSim.github.io/AtomsCalculators.jl/dev/) for details.
